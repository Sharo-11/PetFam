            <h2>What is Fostering?</h2>
            <p>
                Fostering a pet is a compassionate act that involves providing a temporary home for animals in need. These pets may be abandoned, rescued from shelters, or come from other challenging situations. As a foster caregiver, you play a crucial role in helping these animals feel safe, loved, and cared for while they await their forever homes. Fostering not only provides shelter but also helps socialize pets, giving them the necessary skills to adapt to family life. It's a fulfilling experience that allows you to bond with pets and witness the joy of watching them thrive. By fostering, you are making a significant impact on the lives of these animals and the community as a whole.
