            <h2>About Our Website</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to our Pet Adoption platform, where we connect loving families with pets in need of a forever home. Our website offers a variety of pets available for adoption, including dogs, cats, parrots, and rabbits. We are dedicated to ensuring that every pet finds a safe and caring environment, and we work closely with animal shelters and rescue groups to make this possible.

            <h2>Adoption Process</h2>
            <p>
                Our adoption process is designed to ensure a smooth transition for both the pet and the adopter. Here's how it works:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Browse through our available pets and select the one you're interested in.</li>
                <li>Fill out an adoption application form with your details and information about your home environment.</li>
                <li>Our team will review your application and contact you for an interview and home visit.</li>
                <li>If approved, you will be guided through the final steps of the adoption process, including signing an adoption agreement.</li>
                <li>Take your new pet home and start creating beautiful memories together!</li>
            </ol>

        <section class="compatibility-test">
            <h2>Compatibility Test</h2>
            <p>
                Before adopting, it's essential to understand the bond between you and your potential pet. We offer a <a href="/compatibility-test">Compatibility Test</a> to help you assess how well you and your new furry friend will get along. This simple test evaluates your lifestyle, preferences, and compatibility with different types of pets, ensuring you find the perfect match.
