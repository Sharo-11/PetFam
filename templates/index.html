      <p>Provide a loving temporary home to pets in need. Fostering saves lives and gives pets a chance to thrive! You'll help socialize them and prepare them for adoption, making an invaluable impact on their journey. Fostering also allows you to enjoy the companionship of a pet without the long-term commitment, and you’ll be contributing to their transition to a forever home.</p>
